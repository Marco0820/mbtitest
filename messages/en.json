      "introduction_text_1": "People with the ISTJ personality type (Logisticians) mean what they say and say what they mean, and when they commit to doing something, they make sure to follow through. With their responsible and dependable nature, it might not be so surprising that ISTJ personalities also tend to have a deep respect for structure and tradition. They are often drawn to organizations, workplaces, and educational settings that offer clear hierarchies and expectations.",
      "introduction_text_2": "While ISTJs may not be particularly flashy or attention seeking, they do more than their share to keep society on a sturdy, stable foundation. In their families and their communities, people with this personality type often earn respect for their reliability, their practicality, and their ability to stay grounded and logical in even the most stressful situations.",
      "introduction_text_3": "People with the ISTJ personality type believe that there is a right way to proceed in any situation. They rarely hesitate to take responsibility for their actions and choices. They are quick to own up to their mistakes, admitting the truth even if it doesn't make them look good. To ISTJ personalities, honesty and straightforward communication are far more important than showmanship.",
      "introduction_text_4": "ISTJs' dedication is an admirable quality, and it drives many of their accomplishments. But it can also become a weakness that other people take advantage of. With their strong work ethic and sense of duty, they may routinely find themselves shouldering other people's responsibilities. ISTJ personalities can end up exhausted or discouraged if they're constantly expected to pick up the slack for their colleagues, friends, or loved ones.",

      "strength_1_title": "Honest and Direct",

      "strength_3_title": "Very Responsible",
      "strength_3_text": "Their word is a promise, and a promise means everything. They would rather go without sleep than fail to deliver on a promise. Loyalty is a strong sentiment for them, and they meet their duties to the people and organizations they've committed themselves to.",
      "strength_4_title": "Calm and Practical",
      "strength_4_text": "None of their promises would mean much if they lost their cool and gave up at the first sign of difficulty. They keep their feet on the ground and make clear, rational decisions.",
      "strength_5_title": "Create and Enforce Order",
      "strength_5_text": "Their primary goal is to be effective in what they've chosen to do, and they believe this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what to do and why. They don't make assumptions, approaching situations with clarity and accuracy.",
      "weaknesses_title": "ISTJ Weaknesses",
      "weakness_1_title": "Stubborn",
      "weakness_1_text": "The facts are the facts, and they tend to resist any new idea or theory that isn't supported by them. This can make it difficult for them to change their mind or accept new ways of doing things.",
      "weakness_2_title": "Insensitive",
      "weakness_2_text": "While not intending to be, they can hurt more sensitive types' feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. They may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said.",
      "weakness_3_title": "Always by the Book",
      "weakness_3_text": "They believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this can make them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things, even when the downside is minimal.",
      "weakness_4_title": "Judgmental",
      "weakness_4_text": "They have strong convictions about what is and isn't socially acceptable. Their intolerance for gray areas can make it difficult for them to respect those who don't share their values.",
      "weakness_5_title": "Often Unreasonably Blame Themselves",
      "weakness_5_text": "All this can combine to make them believe they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and take on others' responsibilities, they can come to a point where they are unknowingly setting themselves up for failure.",
      "romantic_relationships_title": "Romantic Relationships",
      "romantic_relationships_text_1": "As creatures of habit, ISTJs tend to deeply respect the traditions that they were brought up with, and they hope to share their culture and their values with a partner. Their reserved and structured nature can make dating challenging, but people with this personality type are truly dedicated partners, willing to devote tremendous thought and energy to ensure stable and mutually satisfying relationships.",
      "romantic_relationships_text_2": "People with the ISTJ personality type approach relationships from a rational perspective, looking for compatibility and the mutual satisfaction of daily and long-term needs. This isn't a process that they take lightly, and once commitments are established, they stick to their promises to the very end. They establish foundations, fulfill their responsibilities, and keep their relationships functional and stable.",
      "romantic_relationships_text_3": "ISTJs can get so caught up in believing in their own correctness, in winning arguments that they thought were about facts, that they don't realize their partner may have viewed things from a perspective of consideration and sensitivity. Especially with more sensitive partners, this can be a huge challenge for their relationships.",
      "friendships_title": "Friendships",
      "friendships_text_1": "What ISTJ friends are is loyal, trustworthy, honorable, and dependable. Others may come and go with the ups and downs of life, but ISTJ personalities stay by their friends' sides no matter what, with a deepness of commitment that other types may not even believe is possible.",
      "friendships_text_2": "Expressing emotional affection isn't one of ISTJs' stronger skills, but they nevertheless find ways to show it. Their willingness to take action as a show of support stands in for their words. They enjoy relaxing and having fun with a good discussion about work, life, and current events with friends.",
      "friendships_text_3": "People with this personality type don't like conflict and most often befriend people who are likely to share their perspective and world vision. While they are unlikely to become friends with substantially different personalities, they still recognize and appreciate others' strengths and qualities.",
      "parenthood_title": "Parenthood",
      "parenthood_text_1": "ISTJ personalities' sense of discipline and honor blend well with a tradition that has been in place since time immemorial: to raise one's children to be respected, contributing members of a home and society at large. They establish stable, clearly structured environments for their children, always with an eye on helping them to develop a sense of place in society and to fulfill useful roles.",
      "parenthood_text_2": "All this loyalty, devotion, and structure can fall short when their children need the warmth of emotional support. It's hard for children to recognize their tough love for the love that it is. Often these personalities need to work on developing more empathy and understanding as their children grow.",
      "parenthood_text_3": "ISTJ parents are strongly principled, valuing patience and hard work. Their children are expected to meet these standards and share these values for their own good. This approach often bears its fruit in the long run, but they must keep in mind that their approach creates natural barriers and distance.",
      "career_paths_title": "Career Paths",
      "career_paths_text_1": "The most common ISTJ careers revolve around institutions of respected tradition, authority, security, and established consistency. Careers as military officers, lawyers, judges, police officers, and detectives are all very popular among ISTJs.",
      "career_paths_text_2": "There are many other roles that utilize their reliability, objectivity, and sharp eyes. When facts and logic are out of place, they swoop in as the accountants, auditors, data analysts, financial managers, business administrators, and doctors that identify and correct the issues at hand.",
      "career_paths_text_3": "The best career paths for ISTJ personalities tend to feature a trend: they place facts above feelings and allow them to uphold the hard standards that are the backbone of society.",
      "workplace_habits_title": "Workplace Habits",
      "workplace_habits_text_1": "In all positions, ISTJ personalities seek structure, clearly defined rules, and respect for authority and hierarchy. Responsibilities aren't burdens to them, but a sense of trust that has been placed in them.",
      "workplace_habits_text_2": "As employees, they crave responsibility, which makes them the go-to subordinates for challenging tasks. Among colleagues, no one can be trusted more to ensure that projects are finished on time and by the book. As managers, they love responsibility and the power resulting from it, and they expect their subordinates to act with the same level of dedication.",
      "conclusion_title": "Conclusion",
      "conclusion_text": "Few personality types are as practical and dedicated as ISTJs. Counting on key strengths like reliability and hard work, these personalities are good at creating and maintaining a secure and stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. Their dedication is invaluable in many areas, including their own personal growth."

      "weakness_2_title": "Take Things Too Personally",
      "weakness_2_text": "They have difficulty separating personal and impersonal situations. Any negativity from conflict or criticism can carry over from their professional to their personal lives, and back again.",
      "weakness_3_title": "Repress Their Feelings",
      "weakness_3_text": "They are private and very sensitive, internalizing their feelings a great deal. This can lead to a build-up of frustration and resentment.",

      "weakness_5_text": "They have a deep respect for tradition and history, which can make them reluctant to change. This can be a challenge when new ideas or ways of doing things are proposed.",

They love patterns, and spotting discrepancies between statements is practically a hobby, making it a bad idea to lie to a Logician. This makes it ironic that Logicians' word should always be taken with a grain of salt – it's not that they are dishonest, but people with the Logician personality type tend to share thoughts that are not fully developed, using others as a sounding board for their ideas and theories in a debate against themselves rather than as actual conversation partners.",
      "introduction_text_3": "This can make them appear unreliable, but in reality no one is more enthusiastic and capable of spotting a problem, drilling through the endless factors and details that encompass the issue and developing a unique and viable solution than Logicians – just don't expect punctual progress reports. People who share the Logician personality type aren't interested in practical, day-to-day activities and maintenance, but when they find an environment where their creative genius and potential can be expressed, there is no limit to the time and energy Logicians will expend in developing an insightful and unbiased solution.",

While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.",

When deciding how to move forward, they will look to honor, beauty, morality and virtue – Mediators are led by the purity of their intent, not rewards and punishments. People with the Mediator personality type are proud of this quality, and rightly so, but not everyone understands the drive behind these feelings, and it can lead to isolation.",
      "introduction_text_3": "At their best, these qualities enable Mediators to communicate deeply with others, easily speaking in metaphors and parables, and understanding and creating symbols to share their ideas. The strength of this intuitive communication style lends itself well to creative works, and it's no wonder that many famous Mediators are poets, writers and actors. It is important for Mediators to understand themselves and their place in the world.",
